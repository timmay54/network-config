# network-config

## Tim's internal network
This repo is meant to help others understand some internal networking concepts, as well as find new technologies to implement in their own environment. As the popularity of running a "homelab" increases, there will be more technologies that are introduced and some users will need to adapt these to work inside of their networks. I have a fair amount of restrictions/hurdles in my environment, and here I explain how I get past these issues.

### Background
I work in the DevOps branch of Computer Science, and have worked with network engineers in past roles. Implementing a network from he modem down has always been my thought process, and understanding how subnetting can play a role in software projects can really help organize large projects for beginners. It also helps computer science students see the larger picture, and how their code affects the network.
